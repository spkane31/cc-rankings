## Issues
Some of the results pages will list the team results for multiple division, ie (https://www.tfrrs.org/results/xc/15030/NCCAA_National_Championships), which throws off how the data is scraped. For now I'm ignoring these results, but will come back to it, there's a lot of races that have multiple division scoring in them.
