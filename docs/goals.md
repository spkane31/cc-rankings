# Goals

1. The primary goal of this project is to develop a working site that will create a ranking system for collegiate cross country performances. The steps to getting there are more difficult.

2. A secondary goal is to learn a new toolset, and entirely new, a functional programming language. I will be writing Elixir code and using the Phoenix framework for the web development.

3. This is also a tool for me to develop a project of my own from start to finish and reallychallenge myself.
